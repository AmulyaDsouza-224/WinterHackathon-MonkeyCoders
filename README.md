# Healthcare Management System (HMS)

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Healthcare Management System (HMS)** is a full-stack digital platform designed to centralize and streamline hospital and clinic operations. It addresses the inefficiencies caused by fragmented tools and manual processes used for managing patient data, appointments, medical records, billing, and administrative tasks.

The system provides a unified interface for **patients**, **doctors**, and **administrators**, improving coordination, reducing errors, and enhancing overall healthcare delivery.
